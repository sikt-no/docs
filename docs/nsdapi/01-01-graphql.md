### What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a strongly typed data query language for APIs. If you are not familiar with GraphQL then request you to visit http://graphql.org/ to learn the basics.  

### Why is NSD using graphQL?
NSD chose GraphQL for its API because it serves the needs of modern applications and use cases that are the reality of todayâ€™s technological landscape. It supports the need to build integrated yet diversified solutions that can be harnessed via single point API.  Most services provided by NSD will be available via the GraphQL API.

Even though GraphQL is quite similar to REST, some of the small changes in GraphQL make it a better choice of the use we aim to serve - seamless and easy integration of  third party applications with our services.

### About the GraphQL Reference schema
The GraphQL API documentation is generated by the NSD GraphQL schema. All calls are validated and executed against the schema. You can access this same content via [GraphiQL](https://api.nsd.no/graphiql). GraphiQL is an in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL.
