- `arrExistingAccessZones`, `arrAccessZonesToAdd`, `arrAccessZonesToRemove`: Arrays for existing, added, and removed access zones.
- `changes`, `changedFieldNames`: The changes detected in the record and their field names.
- `recordAdd`, `recordRemove`: Records for adding and removing attributes in Portal LDAP.
- `extProperties`: Extended properties for the user.

#### Workflow
1. **Initialize Variables**
- Set initial values for counters and other variables.
- Adjust `key_field` and `key_value` based on input parameters.

2. **Create Connections**
- Establish connections to Portal LDAP and MV.
- Handle connection errors by logging and invoking `G3_ErrorHandler`.

3. **Fetch Access Zones**
- Load and parse JSON files for access zones.
- Populate `arrAccessZonesMaintainedByRI` with access zones maintained by RI.

4. **Query Records**
- Fetch records from Portal LDAP based on `key_field` and `key_value`.
- If no specific key is provided, use a change iterator to fetch records.

5. **Iterate Over Records**
- For each record, skip if the change type is "delete".
- Fetch detailed LDAP record and skip if essential attributes are missing.
- Skip accounts already processed.
- Determine user entitlements and provisioning status.
- Log processing information.

6. **Transform Record**
- Perform static and dynamic transformations on the record.
- Set various attributes like `FirstName`, `Surname`, `ControlNumber`, `ExtendedInfo1`, `ExtendedInfo2`, `ExtendedInfo3`, `ExtendedInfo4`, `ExtendedInfo5`, `ExtendedInfo7`, `FreeInfo1`, `accessZones`, `ParentFolderPath`, etc.
- Remove attributes that should not be provisioned to Integra.

7. **Match and Update Integra**
- **Check Existence in Integra**:
    - Check if the user exists in Integra.
    - Handle errors and duplicate accounts.
- **Create New Account**:
    - If the user does not exist in Integra and is entitled to Integra, create a new account.
    - Perform necessary data formation and set attributes.
    - Log the creation process and update Portal LDAP with provisioning status.
- **Update Existing Account**:
    - If the user exists in Integra, compare changes and update the account if necessary.
    - Handle enabling, disabling, moving, and renaming of the account based on the user's entitlements and changes.
    - Log the update process and update Portal LDAP with provisioning status if needed.

8. **Close Connections**
- Close all established connections to Portal LDAP and MV.

9. **Log Results**
- Log the results of the synchronization process, including totals for each operation and failures.

#### External Systems and Communications
- **Portal LDAP**: Used to fetch user records and update user attributes.
- **MV (RIDB)**: Used to query user roles and affiliations.
- **Integra**: The target system where user accounts are created, updated, enabled, disabled, and moved.

#### Response Codes/Outputs
- None explicitly mentioned.

#### Summary
This script handles the provisioning of new and updated users to Integra. It processes user records, performs necessary transformations, and updates or creates user accounts in Integra. The script ensures data consistency and logs detailed results of the synchronization process.
