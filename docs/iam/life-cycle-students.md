title: Life cycle process for Students
---

This process is divided into two policy paths:

1.	Study right is primary (Global.fsStudyRightEndDateIsPrimary = true) which only considers start and end dates to determine whether a student account should be active or not;
2.	Study right is secondary (Global.fsStudyRightEndDateIsPrimary = false) which considers the earliest date from student teaching (“undervisningsmelding”), student assessment (“vurderingsmelding”) and study right (“studierett”) as the start date and latest date from the same set as the end date.

In addition to the above, early activation and grace period applies, which is detailed further in the process table.
